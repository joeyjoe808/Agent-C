## ⚡ Core Operating Principles

### 1. Research First, Code Second
**ALWAYS** read files completely before modifying them:
```bash
# Before editing any file:
1. Read the entire file
2. Understand all imports and dependencies
3. Map the call chain
4. Identify side effects
5. THEN make changes
```

### 2. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
**Write tests FIRST**, then implement:
```python
# RED → GREEN → REFACTOR
1. Write failing test
2. Write minimal code to pass
3. Refactor while keeping tests green
```

### 3. Observer Pattern for Safety
**Never modify existing core files** - use transparent wrappers:
```python
# ✅ GOOD: Observer pattern
class SafeSession:
    def __init__(self):
        self._agent = None  # Wrap existing agent

    def record_tool_call(self, tool, args):
        # Observe without interfering
        pass

# ❌ BAD: Modifying existing code
# Don't edit agency.py or tool files directly
```

### 4. "PROVE IT WORKS" Philosophy
**95% done but not proven = 0% done**

Before marking any task complete:
- [ ] All tests passing (new + existing)
- [ ] Manual validation performed
- [ ] Existing functionality verified unbroken
- [ ] Documentation updated

## 🏗️ Agency-Code Architecture

### Project Structure
```
Agency-Code/
├── agency.py                 # Main orchestrator (spawns agents)
├── agency_code_agent/        # YOU (Coder agent)
│   ├── instructions.md       # Your instructions
│   └── tools/                # Your tools (Read, Write, Edit, etc.)
├── planner_agent/            # Planner agent
├── safety/                   # Safety architecture (Phase 4)
│   ├── safe_session.py       # Session wrapper
│   ├── timeout_monitor.py    # Timeout detection
│   ├── runaway_detector.py   # Runaway detection
│   ├── background_monitor.py # Auto-termination
│   └── cancellation.py       # Ctrl+C handler
├── tools/                    # Shared tools
├── shared/                   # Utilities & hooks
└── tests/                    # 181+ tests
```

### Safety Architecture (Phase 4 Complete)
- **TimeoutMonitor**: 30min session / 5min turn / 2min tool timeouts
- **RunawayDetector**: Catches infinite loops (5+ same tool calls)
- **BackgroundMonitor**: Optional auto-termination (threading.Thread)
- **CancellationHandler**: Graceful Ctrl+C handling

**Key Design**: Transparent wrapper pattern - safety layer can be removed without breaking system.

## 📋 Project-Specific Rules

### Code Modification Guidelines
1. ❌ **NEVER modify** `agency.py` directly
2. ❌ **NEVER modify** existing tool files in `tools/`
3. ❌ **NEVER modify** `agency_code_agent.py` or `planner_agent.py`
4. ✅ **DO create** new files in `safety/` for safety features
5. ✅ **DO use** observer pattern to wrap existing code
6. ✅ **DO write** tests first (TDD)

### When Adding Safety Features
```python
# Pattern to follow:
1. Create NEW file in safety/ (don't modify existing)
2. Use transparent wrapper pattern
3. Make it removable (observer, not modifier)
4. Write tests FIRST
5. Ensure existing tests still pass
```

### Testing Requirements
- **Coverage**: ≥80% overall, 100% for critical paths
- **Test files**: `tests/test_<feature>.py`
- **Run before commit**: `pytest tests/ -v`
- **Safety tests**: 44 tests must always pass

## 🎨 Code Style Standards

### Python Style
```python
# 4-space indentation
def example_function(param: str) -> dict:
    """Descriptive docstring explaining purpose.

    Args:
        param: Description of parameter

    Returns:
        Description of return value
    """
    result = {"key": "value"}
    return result

# Type hints on ALL functions
# Descriptive names (no abbreviations)
# Docstrings on public functions
# Functions ≤50 lines
# Classes ≤150 lines
```

### Naming Conventions
- **Files**: `snake_case.py`
- **Classes**: `PascalCase`
- **Functions**: `snake_case()`
- **Variables**: `snake_case`
- **Constants**: `UPPER_CASE`

### Error Handling
```python
# Comprehensive error handling
try:
    result = risky_operation()
except RecoverableError as e:
    # Retry with exponential backoff
    pass
except FatalError as e:
    # Log and raise
    logging.error(f"Fatal: {e}")
    raise
```

---

## 🛡️ Safety Architecture Guidelines

### Phase 4 Implementation Complete
All safety features follow these principles:

**1. Transparent Design**
```python
# Safety can be disabled without breaking system
if USE_SAFE_SESSION:
    session = SafeSession()
else:
    session = None  # System works without it
```

**2. Observer Pattern**
```python
# Monitor, don't modify
class BackgroundMonitor:
    def _check_session(self):
        # READ session state
        # EMIT events
        # DON'T modify agent behavior directly
```

**3. Opt-In Enforcement**
```python
# Auto-termination is opt-in (default: False)
monitor = BackgroundMonitor(
    session,
    config,
    auto_terminate=False  # Default: detection only
)
```

**4. Graceful Degradation**
```python
# Errors in safety layer shouldn't crash agent
try:
    monitor.check_session()
except Exception as e:
    logging.warning(f"Monitor error: {e}")
    # Agent continues working
```

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### For Every Task

```yaml
Phase 1 - Research (MANDATORY):
  - [ ] Read ALL files that will be affected
  - [ ] Map complete dependency graph
  - [ ] Identify integration points
  - [ ] List potential side effects
  - [ ] Create RESEARCH_*.md if complex

Phase 2 - Design:
  - [ ] Choose observer/wrapper pattern
  - [ ] Design for removability
  - [ ] Define clear interfaces
  - [ ] Plan error handling
  - [ ] Write test cases FIRST

Phase 3 - Implementation:
  - [ ] Write tests FIRST (RED)
  - [ ] Implement minimal code (GREEN)
  - [ ] Add error handling
  - [ ] Refactor (REFACTOR)
  - [ ] Document inline

Phase 4 - Validation:
  - [ ] All new tests passing
  - [ ] All existing tests passing
  - [ ] Manual validation complete
  - [ ] No functionality broken
  - [ ] Integration verified
```

### Before Marking Task Complete
Run this checklist:
```bash
# 1. Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v

# 2. Run safety tests specifically
pytest tests/test_session_metrics.py \
       tests/test_safe_session.py \
       tests/test_timeout_monitor.py \
       tests/test_runaway_detector.py \
       tests/test_background_monitor.py \
       tests/test_cancellation.py -v

# 3. Verify imports work
python -c "from safety import SafeSession, TimeoutConfig, BackgroundMonitor, CancellationHandler; print('OK')"

# 4. Verify agent runs
python agency.py  # Should start without errors
```

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns to AVOID

### ❌ Never Do This:
```python
# DON'T modify existing tool files
# File: tools/bash.py
def run(self):
    # Adding safety tracking HERE ← WRONG
    self.track_execution()  # DON'T

# DON'T skip tests to "save time"
# DON'T assume you understand without reading
# DON'T optimize working code unless needed
# DON'T make things "prettier" instead of functional
```

### ✅ Always Do This:
```python
# CREATE new files for safety systems
# File: safety/execution_tracker.py
class ExecutionTracker:
    def track_tool_execution(self, tool_name, args):
        # Observer pattern ← CORRECT
        pass

# WRITE tests first
# READ files completely before editing
# MAP dependencies before coding
# VALIDATE nothing broke
```

---

## 🎯 Webhook Integration

### Hook System
Agency-Code has a powerful hook system in `shared/system_hooks.py`:

```python
def on_tool_execution(tool_name: str, args: dict):
    """Called BEFORE every tool execution"""
    # Perfect for webhooks, logging, tracking
    pass

def on_tool_completion(tool_name: str, result: dict):
    """Called AFTER every tool execution"""
    # Send completion webhooks
    pass

def on_agent_handoff(from_agent: str, to_agent: str):
    """Called on agent handoffs"""
    # Track agent interactions
    pass
```

**Use Case**: Backend API for web applications
- Hooks trigger on every action
- Send real-time updates to front-end
- Track costs, logs, metrics
- Perfect for SaaS platforms

## 🧪 Testing Philosophy

### Test Coverage Requirements
- Overall: ≥80%
- Critical paths: 100%
- Error paths: ALL tested
- Integration: ALL tested

### Test Structure
```python
# Unit test
def test_session_metrics_initialization():
    """Test SessionMetrics starts with empty state"""
    metrics = SessionMetrics()
    assert metrics.tool_calls == []
    assert metrics.reasoning_steps == 0

# Integration test
def test_agency_with_safe_session():
    """Test SafeSession doesn't break existing agent"""
    agent = create_agency_code_agent(model="claude-haiku-4-5")
    session = SafeSession()
    session.set_agent(agent)

    # Agent should work exactly as before
    assert agent.name == "AgencyCodeAgent"
```

---

## 💡 Quick Reference

### Before ANY Code Change
```bash
1. Did you read ALL affected files?
2. Did you map the complete call chain?
3. Did you identify ALL side effects?
4. Did you write tests FIRST?

If NO to any: STOP. Go back and do it.
```

### Key Mantras
- **"Research first, code second"**
- **"If it's not tested, it's broken"**
- **"GRAFT onto existing, don't rebuild"**
- **"Observer pattern - watch, don't modify"**
- **"95% done but not proven = 0% done"**
- **"Make it work first, optimize never (unless needed)"**
