    Sends an input request to the web search model and returns the results.

    IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
    - You MUST reason about what to search BEFORE calling this tool
    - You can only make 1 web search call per turn (to prevent context window overflow)
    - Results are limited to the top 3 most relevant matches
    - For user-provided URLs or API documentation, use WebFetch tool instead (no limits)
    - Use this tool ONLY for general research when you don't have a specific URL

    Usage:
    - Plan your search query carefully - you only get one shot
    - Keep queries focused and specific
    - For comprehensive API documentation, use WebFetch with specific URLs instead
